Computer Science Final Project

This is the front end of Trading Algorithm which is the front-end of a program that takes data from sites like Yahoo finance and 
tells users when to buy and sell their stocks. I developed a website that included a form that would ideally be used to gather user information. 

In creating the website I used React which is a JavaScript library for building UIs. As far as frameworks, I used gatsby, a static site generator, to build my site. The languages I used were HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

Use npm run test to run jest test

Run ESLint on any file or directory like this:
